### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?
  Resource Chosen: Downloaded and worked with football/futball/soccer data by joining multiple tables to analyze historical data, focusing on taggings and tags data. I didn't choose this because I wanted more challenges though, I want to make that clear. :D

I chose this because I wanted to learn how to work with .csv files. I'm planning future projects wherein data comes in .csv format.

- What are three things you learned during this lab?
  Data Importation:

Learned how to import CSV files into PostgreSQL using the COPY command with proper delimiter settings and handling headers.

SQL Joins:

Gained experience in using SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables, extracting meaningful insights such as which tags are associated with which taggable items.

Saw Data for Data Analysis:

Learned I probably need to learn another language if I want to work with DATA, like python or r.
